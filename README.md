## 👨‍💻 About Me

**Software engineer** focused on building **robust and scalable systems**. I have a strong foundation in **SOLID principles**, **design patterns**, **clean architecture**, and overall **software engineering best practices**. Rather than being tied to a specific stack or framework, my approach is based on **adaptability** and **continuous learning**, allowing me to quickly integrate into new technologies and development paradigms.

Currently, I specialize in developing **embedded and distributed systems in C++ for the defense sector**, working in **critical environments** that demand **high performance, reliability, and precision**.

Alongside my professional career, I work on **full-stack personal projects** aimed at **learning and experimentation**, where I explore **modern, scalable architectures** often deployed in the cloud. I'm especially motivated by tackling **challenging web-based problems**, exploring **new technologies**, and applying **best practices in design and deployment**.

I'm also interested in **technical leadership** and **team coordination**, with the goal of contributing not only through code, but also by helping **organize, guide, and scale projects effectively**.
